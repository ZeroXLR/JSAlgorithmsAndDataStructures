# Description:

This is a project to accustom myself with basic algorithms and data structures. This is a work in progress. Eventually, I would like to implement the following:

1. Basic sorts like merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.
2. Basic data structures that JavaScript does not yet implement out-of-the-box like binary trees, priority queues, disjoint-sets, etc.

This is a work in progress. I will slowly continue adding features that I deem fit. I am open to suggestions.
